# Meteor App: MyMp

Lookup your (UK) MP data using Meteor - the site is under active development as I'm using it for learning.

**This was started as an educational app to learn Meteor but I'd like to see it grow as I add extra features. See below for my plans**

It's a basic app but one I'm passionate about:
 * New technology.
 * APIs.
 * Politics.
 
## Thank You
* This couldn't be possible without the incredible **[They Work For You](https://www.mysociety.org/)** service and the parent non-profit **My Society** - thank you!!
* Secondly the [Meteor platform](http://www.meteor.com) which is just plain awesome. I'm still new to it so please be gentle with my code. In the spirit of good open source relations provide constructiv criticism or even better fork and offer pull requests. There's nothing more crushing than inexplicable, unhelpful criticism).

## Future Developments and Plans
Oh I'm an ambitious sort. Especially with new tech like this. Here's a quick rundown:
* Cache the results receieved s I'm not abusing the TWFY service too much.
* Constituency map with boundary marking.
* Twitter AP hookup to a particular MP's twitter feed or mentions of the MP.
* Hook into the UK Police API to also provide local police data.

## Suggestions & Feedback
I'm happy to hear. whether I'll agree or not is a different story but I'm sure we can have a good chat about it. If you feel so inclined then fork and multiply!!!!
